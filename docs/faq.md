### 1. Can I install only a Aspia Router or only a Aspia Relay to bypass NAT?
No. Both of these components must be installed. The Router is designed to issue address IDs, and it also helps the Host and Client agree on which Relay server to use.
The Relay is designed to relay traffic between the Host and the Client. There can be many Relay servers, but there is always one Router.

### 2. Can I install Aspia Router and Aspia Relay on one computer?
Yes. There are no obstacles to this, however, if there is a large number of computers (more than 500-1000) or if many simultaneous connections to Hosts are planned,
then it is recommended to place the Relay and Router on different computers (in this case, more than one Relay server may be required).

### 3. When connecting to the Host, a notification panel appears. How to hide it?
It's impossible to do. When connecting to a computer, the user must be explicitly notified that his computer is under remote control.
Aspia is not an application for hidden tracking of users. Antivirus companies also require this notification in order for the application to be on the antivirus white lists.
